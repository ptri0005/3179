                    <p>
                        Natural disasters kill on average 60,000 people per year and are responsible for 0.1% of global
                        deaths.
                        What we observe is that the number of deaths can be incredibly low over several years â€” often
                        less than
                        10,000, and accounting for as little as 0.01 percent of all deaths.
                        But we also see the disastrous effects of shock events, such as Ethiopia's famine and drought in
                        1983-85,
                        the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Myanmar's Cyclone Nargis in 2008, and Haiti's 2010
                        Port-au-Prince earthquake.
                        All of these incidents contributed to the deaths of almost 200,000 people worldwide, accounting
                        for more
                        than 0.4 percent of all deaths in these years.

                    <span id="subtitle">Largest Earthquakes</span>
                    <p>From the visualisation, it can be seen that the largest earthquakes in the world happen rather
                        sequentially, namely alongst the borders of large tectonic plates.
                        Unfortunately for Chile, 2 of the world's top 5 most intense earthquakes occured there as a
                        country that
                        resides alongst the edge of the South American plate.
                        Earthquakes cause devastation by not only destroying the foundation of buildings through waves
                        of powerful
                        tremors, but also through huge tsunami waves that cuts across the mainland laying waste in its
                        wake.
                        The Valdivia earthquake alone had left over 2,000,000 homeless after the destruction. </p>

                    <p>Historically, it can be seen that floods are one of the deadliest natural disasters. Primarily
                        occuring in
                        China, certain flood events can claim hundreds of thousands of lives - or even millions such as
                        the 1931
                        China floods which had the Yangtze - Huai River flooding hit major cities such as Wuhan, Nanjing
                        and beyond.
                        Flooding not only damages infrastructure, but also livestock and agriculture that ensures famine
                        to cause
                        hundreds of thousands of deaths afterwards.

                    <p>When a storm's maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph, it is called a hurricane. The Saffir-Simpson
                        Hurricane
                        Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating, or category, based on a hurricane's maximum sustained winds. The
                        higher the
                        category, the greater the hurricane's potential for property damage. Typhoon Ida had costed up
                        to 64.8
                        Billion Dollars in damage repairs, stretching from cuba all the way through USA up to Canada.
                        The top 10
                        hurricanes with the highest speeds have all originated either from the West or Western Pacfic.

                        earthquakes
                        have experienced a drastic spike in the 1990s. This means that we are experiencing rather
                        consistent
                        earthquake intensities but at a much more frequenct rate. </p>

                    <p>Flood deaths experience a drastic drop after the 1920s-1940s, which included the catastrophic
                        major river
                        floods in China that have caused millions of deaths. Since then, better methods of dealing with
                        floods have
                        been put in place such as flood barriers and dams that have significantly reduced deaths.</p>

                        since the 1980s - 2000s. However, from just the statistics we cannot conclude that storms have
                        been growing
                        less intense overall but the downwards trend in mean storm speeds may be attributed to less
